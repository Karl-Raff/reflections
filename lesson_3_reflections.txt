Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository instead of keeping all your work local?

A1: Some examples of when you might use a remote repositry are:
    When you want to collaborate with multiple developers.
    When you want to share your work across multiple machines.
    When you want to make your work publicly available.

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
    stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A2: Always manually pulling changes allows you to control when you're local repository is
    changed, it also allows you to control what branches of the remote repo you want to
    pull from.
