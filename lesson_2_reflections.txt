Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A1: When you initialize a git repository, it creates a .git sub-directory
    which stores all of the git metadata required for version control.
    This is required to enable git to track and operate on commits.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and
    the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A2: The staging area is different in that it is a place to add only the
    files that you wish to be added to the commit. Having this area allows
    for a much greater level of control over what is committed and what isn't.
